# StabilitySelection
This is package for performing stability selection in MATLAB, using a variety of feature selection/ranking algorithms that come packaged with MATLAB's machine learning toolbox. This comes with a variety of live code tutorials that show how to: 1) run stabSel, 2) properly set up cross-validation and nested cross-validation schemes, 3) build predictive models using other algorithms available in MATLAB's machine learning toolbox after performing stability selection.

Stability selection can help you understand which features are reliably predictive and we have several tutorials below that show that it can also help you build more generalizable models. Here is a visual demonstration:

For a better understanding of stabSel and how to use it, I recommend starting with Tutorial1_PredictSongYear.mlx, where you will try predicting the year a song was produced using audio features. Example 1 is particularly important, the remaining examples are more supplemental and build on example 1. This tutorial showcases regression techniques in stabSel and provides an introduction for how you can properly setup nested CV schemes when using matlab's machine learning toolbox. 

Tutorial2_PredictMOCA.mlx attempts to predict at-risk moca scorers from discourse measures. This tutorial showcases more basic classification techniques in stabSel. It also showcases how to build more complex predictive models after performing stability selection in a nested CV scheme (e.g., random forest, SVMs, etc). This example demonstrates settings in which stabSel massively boosts performance and settings where it does very little because the predictive model is already doing a good job of modeling signal features. This tutorial also contains code that may be helpful for tracking/visualizing hyperparameter selection across your nested CV scheme. 

Tutorial3_PredictLSM.mlx is the most extensive, describing injection of stability selection into multivariate lesion symptom mapping. We use our publicly available database of chronic stroke patients with aphasia to show that SVM prediction of aphasia severity from lesion location is better when we include stability selection to identify more stable predictors. We that  stability selection permits SVM to focus on more complex patterns of brain damage and that it helps lower variance in feature importance. This tutorial also has code for generating pretty brain figures using our other repositories and shows you how you might tune the per family error rate in stability selection to attain good models without having to preselect this value. 

Note: I am continuing to develop and add features to this package. If you encounter any issues, or if you have any suggestions, please let me know at: alex.teghipco@sc.edu. There are some feature selection algorithms that have been subjected to less debugging because they take much longer to run so if you run into any issues with them, feedback is extra greatly appreciated (e.g., RFs and GPRs).

Here are some coming updates: 
- The documentation for stabSel.m is sprawling. This will move into a wiki for this repository and the documentation within the main function will be trimmed down 
- Outlier removal is supported but the documentation is currently lacking and will be updated
- More options for multi-task learning
- Support for testing interactions in the context of algorithms that do not automatically do this

Supported regression algorithms: 
- lasso
- elastic net
- adaptive lasso
- adaptive elastic net
- random forest (permuted oob error)
- partial least squares (with Variable Importance Projection) <-- supports multi-task learning
- gaussian process regression (ardsquaredexponential kernel)
- neighborhood component analysis
- Rrelieff
- MRMR
- correlation (p-value to retain or coeff. for ranking)
- robust linear regression (p-value to retain or coeff. for ranking)

Supported classification algorithms:
- random forest
- neighborhood component analysis
- Rrelieff
- MRMR
- t-test or wilcoxon test (ranking based on two-sample test statistic)
- f-test (ranking based on test statistic)
- bhattacharyya: minimum attainable classification error  (ranking)
- entropy or Kullback-Leibler divergence (ranking)
- area between the empirical ROI curve and random classifier slope (ranking)
